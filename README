Goal: Host Provisioning with Python 

1) Always have machines PXE
2a) MAC recognized as 'needs provisioning', so PXE installation ensues
2b) MAC not recognized, so it is ignored, or given random IP and machine boots normally

Tools:

1) DHCP server
2) TFTP server
3) GPXE (might not be needed)
4) Database of MAC addresses, IP address ranges, and boot images/ISOs/configuration
